# Squawker Code

This is a exercise repository for the Squawker app which is part of Udacity's Advanced Android course. The Squawker example app uses Firebase Cloud Messenger to receive Twitter-like messages, sent from [this server](https://squawkerfcmserver.udacity.com/), in real time.
Usage : 
- Install App 
- Go to [server](https://squawkerfcmserver.udacity.com/) to send fake messages
- Just copy and paste my personal Firebase CM Server key : AAAA8zw8vc0:APA91bEXDYYKm4EbCNVT82ywTC8bA6kwuUciKTtncWVev37ufCBvk0W3tS0hgx-xaQjlFiSGpgyghgpDcCeI7wwmB_yB6Y7Xskfylj2ce3HSJPQ6xFseFZ1v7NpqWZZqCSWN4NP86mqz
- Click "Send Sqwak". You will receive receive the message (which includes both the message and the data to trigger a notification)
